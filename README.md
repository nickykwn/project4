# Project-4
## Concept
I was thinking of build an app using the UFC Api. The app would allow users to look for statistics of the fighters in the UFC such as their current win-loss record. The app would also allow users to look up videos of that fighter in previous fights. I would possibly incorporate youtube to show the videos of the fighters. There would also be information for people possibly interested in buying tickets to a UFC event for the time and location of events. I would possibly incorporate the ticketmaster api or create a link between the two sites for users to purchase tickets
